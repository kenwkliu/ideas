Re-run the program and you will get different results and summary reports.\n","*   Current Limitation/Future enhancement: Move to real test/production environment that can process the full result (currently to run in colab, I have only used the first 10 returned rows for LLM prompt).  Change the MAX_SAMPLE variable once moved to a real environment.\n","*   2nd Limitation: As the csv is a monthly updated file, it is recommended to test the program again after a new update, as the resourceID or the file name may have changed which is out of the programmer's (my) control\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3E0L2DwEx4IL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@title Search selected column and generate an LLM report (dropdown + textbox)\n","SEARCH_COLUMN = \"Work Assignment Title\" #@param [\"Work Assignment Title\", \"Contractor Awarded\"]\n","KEYWORD = \"Privacy Impact Assessment\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","MAX_SAMPLE = 10  # number of matched rows to include in the prompt summary\n","\n","import os, re, requests, pandas as pd\n","from IPython.display import display, Markdown\n","from google.colab import ai\n","\n","# --- Config ---\n","RESOURCE_ID = \"8c151c53-e3db-4248-b0f2-23f20e43a082\"\n","CSV_URL = f\"https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dpo-dpo_hp-soa-qps-awarded-service-contracts/resource/{RESOURCE_ID}/download?format=csv\"\n","LOCAL_CSV = \"soa-qps-awarded-service-contracts.csv\"\n","OUT_MATCHES = \"chatbot_matches.csv\"\n","CHUNKSIZE = 100_000  # set None to load whole file at once (not recommended)\n","\n","def md(text): display(Markdown(text))\n","def displayLLMOutput(llmOutput):\n","    display(Markdown(f\"<font size='4'>{llmOutput}</font>\"))\n","\n","# 1) Download CSV if missing\n","if not os.path.exists(LOCAL_CSV):\n","    md(\"**Downloading CSV from data.gov.hk...**\")\n","    resp = requests.get(CSV_URL, timeout=60)\n","    resp.raise_for_status()\n","    with open(LOCAL_CSV, \"wb\") as f:\n","        f.write(resp.content)\n","    md(f\"Saved `{LOCAL_CSV}` ({len(resp.content):,} bytes).\")\n","\n","# 2) Build safe regex from user input\n","escaped = re.escape(KEYWORD.strip())\n","pattern = re.compile(rf\"\\b{escaped}\\b\", flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n","col_name = SEARCH_COLUMN\n","\n","# 3) Detect a working encoding for the CSV header\n","encodings = [\"utf-8-sig\", \"utf-8\", \"latin1\", \"big5\"]\n","used_encoding = None\n","for enc in encodings:\n","    try:\n","        pd.read_csv(LOCAL_CSV, nrows=0, encoding=enc)\n","        used_encoding = enc\n","        break\n","    except Exception:\n","        continue\n","if not used_encoding:\n","    raise RuntimeError(\"Unable to detect a working encoding for the CSV.\")\n","\n","# 4) Prepare output file\n","if os.path.exists(OUT_MATCHES):\n","    os.remove(OUT_MATCHES)\n","\n","md(f\"**Scanning `{LOCAL_CSV}` for `{KEYWORD}` in column `{col_name}`...**\")\n","\n","# 5) Stream and search\n","matches_found = 0\n","reader = pd.read_csv(LOCAL_CSV, chunksize=CHUNKSIZE, encoding=used_encoding, low_memory=False) if CHUNKSIZE else [pd.read_csv(LOCAL_CSV, encoding=used_encoding)]\n","first_write = True\n","sample_rows = []\n","\n","for i, chunk in enumerate(reader, start=1):\n","    if col_name not in chunk.columns:\n","        md(\"**Error:** column `\" + col_name + \"` not found.

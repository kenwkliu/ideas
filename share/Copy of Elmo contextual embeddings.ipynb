Modern slavery is fundamentally unacceptable within our business and supply chain, and combatting it is an \\n\\nimportant element of our overall approach to business and human rights. ASOS is committed to respecting, protecting and championing \\nthe human rights of all those who come into contact with our operations, including employees, supply chain workers, customers and \\n\\nlocal communities.  We accept our responsibility to support transparency; to find and resolve problems, to regularly review our business \\npractices, and to collaborate with others to protect the rights of workers, particularly those who are most vulnerable to abuses such as \\n\\nmodern slavery. \\n\\nThis statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act (2015). It provides an update on our activities and \\ncommitments detailed in our Modern Slavery Statement 2015/16 to prevent modern slavery in our business operations and supply \\n\\nchains, and sets out the steps taken by ASOS PLC during financial year ending 31 August 2017 and the intervening time to publication. \\nIt also outlines our commitments towards mitigating the risk of modern slavery in our supply chains for the next year and to 2020.\\n\\nASOS is a multi-platform online shopping destination selling womenswear, menswear, footwear, accessories, gifts and beauty \\nproducts via our website to millions of young, fashion-loving ’20-somethings’ in 240 countries and territories.   \\n\\nAbout ASOS\\n\\nBUSINESS STRUCTURE\\n\\nASOS is based in the UK, with a head office in London, a smaller technology office in Birmingham and a customer care centre in \\nLeavesden. ASOS fulfilment centres are located in Barnsley (UK) and Berlin (Germany), with additional third-party run returns and \\n\\nreprocessing sites in Australia, the USA, Poland and the UK.  As our business continues to grow, we will expand our supply chain with a \\nfulfilment centre in the USA in 2018.\\n\\n1\\n\\nPRODUCTS ON OUR \\nWEBSITE THIRD-PARTY BRANDS \\n\\nASOS employees\\n\\nASOS brands manufacturing \\nworkers\\n\\nASOS brands suppliers ASOS brands factories tiers 1-3\\n\\nof ASOS supplier factories are located \\nin Bulgaria, China, India, Romania, \\n\\nTurkey, Mauritius and UK\\n\\nOVER\\n\\nASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\n£1,923.6m\\nrevenue\\n\\n3,722 173 624\\n85,000 86% 120,000850\\n\\n\\n\\nASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nWe divide our supply chain into two separate areas: \\n\\n1. Products for re-sale on our website, including ASOS Brands products (‘ASOS Brands’) and other third-party brands’ products     \\n     (‘third-party brands’). \\n\\n2. Non-stock items and services, including outsourced customer deliveries, logistics, technology, cleaning and catering \\n     (‘Non-stock’).\\n\\nASOS Brands products are designed in-house and manufactured by third-party supplier factories. The Sourcing Department \\nmanages the ASOS Brands supply chain. The Ethical Trade and Sustainable Sourcing teams are located within this department to \\nensure product and raw material suppliers are selected based on ethical and sustainable as well as commercial criteria. Product \\nsupply chains are complex, involving a number of different manufacturing processes. ASOS maps and describes them as follows:\\n\\nTERM DEFINITION EXAMPLE STATUS\\n\\nTier 1 Main production sites Factory which cuts, sews, finishes ASOS Brands product and ships to ASOS Fully mapped\\n\\nTier 2 Process integral to production Provider of one or more processes e.g. stitching, cutting, packing, quality control, warehouses 90% mapped* – completion 2017/18\\n\\nTier 3 Enhancements to Product Provider of one or more processes e.g. printing, dyeing, laundry, embroidery 90% mapped* – completion 2017/18\\n\\nTier 4 Fabric and components Fabric mills, tanneries, hardware and trims Partially mapped - completion 2018/19\\n\\nTier 5 Raw materials Textile fibres, natural and manmade materials Key commodities mapped 2020\\n\\nSupply chain transparency is a priority for ASOS. We recognise the importance of supply chain mapping and \\ndue diligence to uphold human rights and prevent undeclared subcontracting. We are always striving to  \\n\\ndevelop ways to ensure the transparency of our supply chain and traceability of our products.\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN\\n\\nTable 1: Tier structure of ASOS Brands supplier factories\\n\\n2\\n\\n* This data is based on the number of suppliers who have accepted our subcontracting policy, requiring them to disclose their lower tier factories if applicable.\\n\\nIn 2017, we published our factory list and an interactive \\nsourcing map, covering all our tier one to tier three sites – \\nthis is updated every two months and shared with IndustriALL \\nGlobal Union, as part of the Global Framework \\nAgreement we signed in October 2017. \\n\\nWe have also developed and disseminated an Unapproved \\nSubcontracting Policy, which strengthens our long-held \\nrequirement for suppliers to declare all factories involved in \\nthe manufacture of ASOS Brands products and work with us \\nto make sure only approved units are used. The policy \\n\\nstresses the requirement for suppliers to have full visibility and \\noversight of their supply chain. They are also required to keep \\ndetailed records relating to every manufacturing unit and  \\nensure that all products supplied to ASOS are manufactured \\nin accordance with the ASOS Supplier Ethical Code. \\nSince we implemented the policy in September 2017, we \\nhave found 18 instances of unapproved subcontracting \\nacross a range of garment manufacturing processes.

Also prohibits the recruitment of \\nyoung migrant workers through labour agents.\\n•  ASOS Migrant and Contract Worker Policy: sets out supplier requirements to safeguard the rights and welfare of migrant \\nand contract workers - two groups vulnerable to exploitation and modern slavery.\\n\\nASOS brands and non-stock suppliers are contractually required to comply with the policies stated above. Third-party brands are \\nrequired to comply with our minimum requirement (see page 7).\\n\\nOther documents relevant to preventing modern slavery in ASOS’ operations include: Do the Right Thing - ASOS Code of  \\nIntegrity, People Handbook, Diversity and Inclusion Statement, Whistle-blowing Policy, Grievance Procedure, Appeals policy, \\nAnti-Bribery Statement and Unapproved Subcontracting Policy.\\n\\nPOLICIES AND CONTRACTUAL CONTROLS\\n\\nDue Diligence\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\nThe Chief Executive and ASOS Executive Committee are responsible for \\nensuring ASOS meets its human rights responsibilities. They are \\nsupported by the Director of Corporate Responsibility, Sourcing Director \\nand Head of Ethical Trade. Our Fashion with Integrity strategy has the \\nfull sign off and commitment of the Executive and PLC Board and we \\nreport to the boards on our progress against our strategic goals on a \\nquarterly basis. \\n\\nHuman rights and modern slavery are key elements of an annual \\ncorporate risk assessment process overseen by the General Counsel and \\nCompany Secretary on behalf of the ASOS PLC Board. The assessment \\nis developed with the participation of 45 senior leaders within the \\norganisation and we report on risks identified in our Annual Report to \\ninvestors.  \\n\\nIn addition, diagram 1 demonstrates our established corporate  \\ngovernance structure with seven business committees responsible for \\noverseeing the delivery of our Fashion with Integrity strategic  \\ncommitments. The governance groups meet monthly to discuss progress \\nagainst strategy, review risks and seek opportunities for senior managers \\n\\nfrom across the business to further embed human rights principles into \\ntheir business areas. Each group is chaired by an executive board \\nmember and comprises of senior management representatives and \\nsubject-matter experts. They report on their activities to the CEO and the \\nboard of directors on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThe following departments are responsible for carrying out day-to-\\nday implementation of policies and procedures that support ASOS \\nin meeting its human rights responsibilities: People Experience Team \\n(ASOS employees), Company Secretariat (whistleblowing), Corporate \\nResponsibility (Fashion with Integrity strategy), Procurement (non-stock \\nsuppliers), Sourcing (Fashion with Integrity strategy within product supply \\nchain) and Supply Chain (outsourced logistics partners), Legal \\n(contractual terms and conditions). \\n\\nWe believe that close collaboration with our Buying, Merchandising, \\nDesign and Garment Technology teams is essential to ensure  \\nmanagement decisions and purchasing practices are aligned with our \\nethical trade goals. To this end, our ethical trade team have regular \\nmeetings with both menswear and womenswear management.\\n\\nASOS Executive Committee\\n\\n20-Something\\n Confidence\\n\\nDiversity and\\nInclusion Sustainable Business\\n\\nNon-Stock Supplier \\nIntegrity\\n\\nProduct Recall \\nDecision Groups Ethical Trade Business Integrity Sustainable Products\\n\\nDiagram 1: Seven business committees of ASOS governance structure\\n\\nhttps://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/documents/corporate-responsiblity/asos-ethical-code-of-conduct-2017.pdf\\nhttps://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/documents/corporate-responsiblity/asos-young-worker-and-child-labour-policy.pdf\\nhttps://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/documents/corporate-responsiblity/asos-migrant-worker-guidelines-2017.pdf\\nhttps://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/reports-and-presentations/27-10-2017-ar.pdf\\n\\n\\nASOS recognises that there is a risk of modern \\nslavery in any area of our business where there \\nis:\\n\\n• Migrant labour (country to country or \\nwithin a country)\\n\\n• High presence of vulnerable populations \\n(such as refugees/ethnic minorities) \\n\\n• Young workers and risk of child labour\\n• Contract, agency and temporary workers\\n• Women workers\\n• Outsourced human resources function\\n\\nASOS’ approach to risk assessment comprises \\nof desk-based research, supply chain mapping \\nand audit, as well as focused due diligence and \\nstakeholder engagement. In particular, we have \\npartnered with Anti-Slavery International, which \\nact as our ‘critical friend’, helping to ensure that \\n\\nour human rights due diligence process is robust \\nand that we are continuously reviewing and \\nmitigating new risks in our supply chain.  \\n\\nTable 2 identifies sourcing regions we assess \\nas highest risk for specific modern slavery \\nissues. Each area of the business is continuously \\nreviewed to set priorities and actions:\\n\\nHigh priority: ASOS Brands product \\nmanufacture, labelling and packaging, offices \\nand fulfilment centres.\\nMedium priority: third-party brands and \\nnon-stock suppliers with a high risk of forced or \\ncompulsory labour as determined by the \\npresence of migrant workers or labour \\nproviders in the low skilled job sector.\\nLow priority: non-stock suppliers with a low \\nrisk of forced or compulsory labour.\\n\\nWe have articulated strategic goals on: supply \\nchain transparency, purchasing practices, \\nfreedom of association, living wage, gender \\nequality, health and safety, modern slavery and \\nchild labour. \\n\\nASOS employs a team of ethical trade \\nspecialists through a third-party (‘the \\nRegional Team’) based in our key product \\nsourcing regions. We are expanding our \\nregional resource by directly recruiting local \\nEthical Trade Managers and team assistance. \\nThis year we employed two Ethical Trade  \\nManagers in Turkey and China and will be  \\nrecruiting managers in Eastern Europe  \\n(Romania) and India in 2018. \\n\\nThese managers are responsible for  \\nimplementing our strategy, managing day to \\nday factory audit programmes, and providing \\nthe key liaison between the ASOS head office \\nin London and the Regional Team. This also \\nensures that those responsible for supporting \\nour supply partners to improve their ethical \\nstandards understand country-specific risks and \\ncan build relationships with local stakeholders \\nto help address them. The Regional Team is \\nsupported by the Ethical Trade team at ASOS \\nhead office in London. The entire international \\nteam meets annually for strategy development, \\ntraining and conferencing.\\n\\nSee here for full details on our Ethical Trade \\nProgramme.\\n \\nASOS has developed its own detailed ethical \\n\\nRISK ASSESSMENT\\n\\nETHICAL TRADE PROGRAMME\\n\\nFast Forward Programme to flag risks of modern \\nslavery in all our UK sites, tiers one to three. \\nASOS’ commercial actions have a direct \\nimpact on suppliers and factories’ ability to \\nmeet our ethical standards. We regularly review \\nour own purchasing practices in order to \\nidentify ways to strengthen supplier \\nrelationships, and ultimately improve working \\nconditions to try and prevent incidences of \\nmodern slavery from occurring. This year, we \\ncommissioned surveys with suppliers and our \\nretail teams to highlight gaps in our practices \\nand agree actions for improving our purchasing \\nmechanisms. \\n\\nWe are one of 17 brands participating in the \\nAction, Collaboration, Transformation (ACT) \\ninitiative in partnership with IndustriALL Global \\nUnion, which holds a commitment to ensure \\nbrand purchasing practices facilitate the \\npayment of a living wage. We are also active \\nmembers of the ACT purchasing practices \\nworking group. \\n\\nWith Action, Collaboration, Transformation, we \\nconducted a Purchasing Practices  \\nSelf-Assessment to review and benchmark our \\nbuying practices. This tool looked at issues as \\nbroad as strategic planning, sourcing,  \\ndevelopment, buying, and the underlying \\nbehaviours, values and principles within our \\nbusiness, all of which can impact a living \\nwage. The outcome highlighted a significant \\nopportunity for ASOS to refine and improve our \\napproach, drive commercial benefit and fulfil \\nour commitment to minimum/living wages.\\n\\n4\\n\\nWhilst we acknowledge that modern slavery \\ncan be found in all economies, countries,  \\nindustries and areas of operation, our initial \\nanalysis has identified that the areas at highest \\nrisk of modern slavery within ASOS operations \\nare garment manufacturing supply chains. Over \\nthe past nine years, ASOS has developed  \\nethical trading policies and programmes with \\nthe aim of discovering and addressing these  \\nissues. This gives us a strong platform from \\nwhich to investigate issues of modern slavery.\\n\\ntrade audit methodology which is designed to \\nsupport and encourage transparency as well \\nas compliance with our Supplier Ethical Code. \\nWhilst we are mindful of the limitations of audits, \\nour programme provides valuable input into \\nour wider risk assessment and programme \\nwork. As we are also aware that perpetrators \\nwill work to conceal these issues from auditors, \\nall ASOS factory audits are unannounced. \\nSemi-announced pre-assessments are carried \\nout for potential new factories in the U.K, Turkey \\nand India by our regional teams as we have \\nconcluded that these regions are particularly \\nhigh-risk. For our other sourcing regions we \\nutilise third-party pre-assessments.\\n\\nWe conduct annual audits at all tier 1 factories \\nin all regions. Further to this we audit all tier 2-3 \\nfactories in Turkey and the U.K, as we \\nrecognise that complex outsourcing supply \\nchains increase the risk of illegal, informal \\nlabour or in the case of Turkey, child labour.\\n\\nOur audit programme also includes specific \\nmodern slavery indicators which are used \\nto assess the risk of modern slavery during \\nsite audits. These include document retention, \\ndeceptive recruitment practices, recruitment \\nfees, withheld wages, restricted movement or \\nisolation, violence or threats, poor working \\nand/or living conditions, and the presence of \\nvulnerable workers. Should any indicators be \\ndiscovered, our Regional Team immediately \\nalerts head office Ethical Trade Managers to \\nagree on appropriate actions. In the UK, we \\nfollow a specific audit methodology through the \\n\\nASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nOur Board approved a new ‘three-year’ Ethical Trade Strategy in Jan ‘17, setting out our long-term vision for  \\nincreasing respect for workers’ rights across our supply chain and mitigating the risk of modern slavery in our  \\n\\noperations. This strategy focusses on improving our business practices to protect human rights in our supply chain \\nfrom the top down, whilst empowering workers to realise their fundamental human rights from the bottom up.\\n\\nhttp://www.asosplc.com/corporate-responsibility/our-products/ethical-trade/ethical-trade-programme.aspx\\n\\n\\nRisk and Steps Taken\\nASOS’ due diligence processes have identified a number of potential modern slavery risks that could be present within our business \\noperations and supply chain. These risks have been summarised in the table below, along with preventative steps taken and a set of \\n\\ncommitments based on gaps apparent in ASOS’ existing programmes.

We continue to raise awareness of  \\nmodern slavery and provide guidance on remediation to our manufacturing sites. Where modern slavery risks are regional or  \\n\\nindustry-wide, we are working in collaboration with our suppliers, industry colleagues, and other key stakeholders on programmes to \\naddress and remediate them.  \\n\\nExamples of particular areas of focus for this reporting period and ongoing:\\n\\nFOCUS ON UNAUTHORISED \\nSUBCONTRACTING IN TURKEY\\n\\nFor the past year, we have been working to  \\naddress issues with migrant labour in our  \\nMauritian supply chain. These include the  \\nrecruitment of migrant workers and the payment of \\nexcessive recruitment fees, often leading to debt \\nbondage.\\n\\nWe adopted a two-pronged approach by working \\nclosely with suppliers to improve their practices, \\nand engaging with other stakeholders to drive \\nchange at a systemic level. We have successfully \\nrolled out the ‘Employer Pays Principle’ in our  \\nsupply chain and supported our suppliers to  \\nimplement this policy. Bangladesh is the largest \\nprovider of migrant labour to Mauritius. In January \\n2018, we visited two of our suppliers’ recruitment \\nagents in Bangladesh with OKUP to monitor \\nongoing recruitment. We conducted interviews with \\nworkers prior to their departure for Mauritius to \\nensure that their recruitment process had been fair \\nand transparent, that they had received adequate \\npre-departure training, and that they had not been \\ncharged any fees. \\n\\nIn recognition that these issues are endemic, we \\nhave continued to work with other brands,  \\ngovernment, industry associations, NGO’s and \\nlocal trade unions to develop interventions that \\naddress the root causes leading to exploitation of \\nmigrant labour. In collaboration with other brands, \\nwe lobbied the Bangladeshi and Mauritian  \\ngovernment to include language on the protection \\nof migrant workers in the Memorandum of  \\nUnderstanding on labour migration which is  \\ncurrently under negotiation between the two  \\ncountries. We have also sought to raise  \\nawareness within the export sector in partnership \\nwith Anti-Slavery International and the Mauritian \\nExport Association, as part of a workshop for local \\nmanufacturers, including our suppliers.\\n\\nIn February 2018, ASOS and the British High \\nCommission to Mauritius hosted an event, bringing \\ntogether local and international stakeholders to dis-\\ncuss the challenges in managing labour migration, \\nand agree a common framework for improving \\nworker protection in Mauritius and beyond. Speak-\\ners included representatives from the Mauritian and \\nBangladeshi governments, the ILO, IOM,  \\nIndustriALL Union, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) \\nand Anti-Slavery International. Attendees also \\nincluded executives from fashion brands  \\nmanufacturing on the island, including adidas, \\nzLabels, PUMA, Woolworths and Whistles, among \\nothers. A core output from the event was the \\ndevelopment of an ETI working group to oversee \\nthe implementation of a roadmap that will focus on \\ndriving further application of the ‘Employer Pays \\nPrinciple’ and improve protection for migrant  \\nworkers from the moment they are recruited, \\nthrough their employment in Mauritius, to their safe \\nreturn to their home country.\\n\\nASOS BRANDS\\n\\n8ASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nTransparency in our supply chain is crucial \\nfor minimising the risk of unauthorised \\nsubcontracting and protecting  \\nvulnerable people. In the past year, we \\nhave increased the visibility of our supply \\nbase in Turkey and will map100% of tiers \\ntwo and three by the end of 2018. \\n\\nWe conduct regular checks to ensure that \\nproduction takes place in authorised units \\nand monitor working conditions. We have \\ndeveloped and published an unapproved \\nsubcontracting policy, which strengthens \\nour long-held requirement for suppliers to \\ndeclare all factories involved in the  \\nmanufacture of ASOS Brands products and \\nwork with us to make sure only approved \\nunits are used. In Turkey, we have identified \\n5 suppliers using unapproved  \\nsubcontracting and 14 sub-contractors \\nmanufacturing ASOS Brands products  \\nwithout ASOS approval. \\n\\nWe identified a requirement for local  \\nmanagement of these issues to better  \\nunderstand country specific risks and  \\nmaintain close proximity to potential risk, \\nand subsequently recruited a local Ethical \\nTrade Manager and an Associate, with a \\nview to also recruit an Assistant in 2018. \\n\\nWe continue to uncover instances of  \\nunauthorised subcontracting and child \\nlabour which remain ongoing challenges. \\nIn this reporting period, we idenitifed and \\nremediated 10 instances of child labour \\nwithin unapproved subcontracted units in \\nTurkey.\\n\\nWe are committed to ensuring there are no \\nun-remediated cases of child labour  \\nanywhere in our supply chain and have \\ncrafted a robust remediation policy and \\nprocess. Our child labour remediation \\npolicy covers schooling of children and \\nproviding a living wage, which is more than \\nthe legal minimum wage, to the family to \\nbe able to keep children in education. We \\nhave established a close partnership with \\nWomen’s Solidarity Foundation KADAV \\nto assist with efforts for eliminating child \\nlabour and closely monitor the children. \\nWe treat the cases with maximum  \\nconfidentiality to prevent any potential \\nadverse human rights impacts on these \\nchildren, their families, or other workers  \\nemployed by these sub-contractors.\\n\\nFOCUS ON RECRUITMENT  \\nPRACTICES AND TREATMENT OF \\n\\nWORKERS IN POLAND\\n\\nWe conducted an assessment of labour \\npractices with Anti-Slavery International in \\none of our returns centres in Poland, which \\nis managed by a third-party logistics firm, \\nand receives and reprocesses our  \\nEuropean returns. The site had been  \\nidentified as potentially high risk in relation \\nto modern slavery, as it employs a  \\nsignificant number of agency workers \\n(61%), the majority of whom are from \\nUkraine. \\n\\nThe assessment identified a number of \\nissues in relation to the treatment of migrant \\nworkers. Many of the migrant workers we \\ninterviewed had used informal agents to \\nsecure employment in Poland, and paid \\nfees for recruitment and transportation in \\nthe region of EUR300. They also reported \\nthat they had little or no contact with their \\nemployer prior to their departure from \\nUkraine, and received no contracts or offer \\nletters detailing their terms of employment. \\n\\nIn a few cases, workers were misinformed \\nabout their terms of employment, or were \\nsold fake invitation letters to Poland. The \\nassessment also highlighted that one \\nlabour agency was subjecting workers to \\nharsh treatment - requiring them to perform \\nadditional unpaid work by way of serving \\nfood to other workers in their  \\naccommodation as a form of  \\ndisciplinary punishment. In addition, we \\nfound evidence of delayed payments of \\nworkers’ wages. We immediately  \\ninstructed the agency to cease its harsh \\ntreatment of workers, and worked with our \\nbusiness partner to implement a  \\nremediation plan. We are looking at \\ntransferring existing workers employed at \\nthis agency into full-time employment at the \\nreturns centre. \\n\\nIn addition, we are supporting our business \\npartner to improve their agency tender \\ncriteria and process to ensure that they \\nonly work with reputable labour providers. \\nThe new tender document includes clear \\ncontractual clauses to ensure that migrant \\nworkers go through a fair and transparent \\nrecruitment process, are not charged for \\nthe cost of recruitment, and are provided \\nwith clear and reliable information about \\ntheir future employment before leaving their \\ncountry of origin. All agency contracts are \\ndue for renewal and renegotiation in 2018, \\nand any existing agency that do not meet \\nthe above criteria will be disqualified. \\n\\nFOCUS ON MIGRANT LABOUR  \\nIN MAURITIUS\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD PARTY BRAND SUPPLIERS\\n\\nASOS stocks over 850 third-party brands, \\nrepresenting 56% of sales. We created new  \\npositions within our Sourcing team responsible \\nfor a more in depth look at our third-party \\nbrand partners, including a Senior Manager  \\ndedicated to designing and rolling out a \\nthird-party brand strategy. At the start of 2018, \\nwe rolled out this strategy, which establishes \\nminimum requirements for all our third-party \\nbrands. We expect all new brands joining \\nASOS to meet these requirements, and are \\nworking with all our existing brands to get there \\nby 2020. \\n\\nWe continue to believe in the power of  \\n‘transformation through collaboration’ and this \\nis the premise on which our third-party brands \\nstrategy is based. Rather than a box-ticking \\napproach, our theory of changes means \\nsupporting brands on the journey to being gold \\nstandard and lifting the industry baseline for \\nhow workers are treated. \\n\\nWe establish compliance level through the  \\ncompletion of a brand self-assessment  \\nquestionnaire and run a programme of training \\nworkshops to ensure brands have the support \\nthey need to meet the requirements.  In 2018 we \\nwill introduce online training modules for those \\n\\n9\\n\\nbrands who are not able to attend our training \\nworkshops in person.\\n\\nMinimum requirements for third-party brands at \\nASOS include:\\n \\n1. An Ethical Trade Policy or an Ethical Code of \\nConduct for suppliers \\n2. Evidence of supply chain transparency to \\ntier one\\n3. A Modern Slavery Statement (where  \\napplicable) \\n4. Compliance with the ASOS Chemical Policy \\n5. Animal Welfare Statement (where applica-\\nble) \\n\\nData gathered from the self-assessment \\nquestionnaires will form the baseline for brand \\nperformance. Over time, as brands comply with \\nminimum requirements, we intend to push for the \\nhigher standards demonstrated by our brand \\npartners with existing robust human rights  \\nprogrammes. By championing mandatory \\n minimum requirements and continuous  \\nimprovement in all areas, ASOS aims to deliver \\na systemic shift in the way brands approach \\nethical trade and sustainability. \\n\\nIn September 2017, we held an inaugural \\n\\nthird-party brand focussed Fashion with \\nIntegrity conference in London. The conference \\nbrought together 80 of our third-party brands, \\nas well as a number of guest speakers. The \\nvarious sessions covered use of sustainable \\nmaterials, chemical compliance, circular  \\neconomy and the challenge of preventing \\nmodern slavery. Key speakers included \\nBaroness Lola Young, Chair of the All-Party \\nParliamentary Group on Ethics and \\nSustainability in Fashion, and Klara \\nSkrivankova from Anti-Slavery International \\nwho were present to engage with brands in \\nnetworking sessions. The objective of the \\nconference was to inspire and encourage \\nbrands to start implementing change in their \\nrespective supply chains. It is now an annual \\nevent.\\n\\nIn addition, we are engaging directly with \\nbrands we consider to be at a high risk of \\nnon-compliance, and also with more \\nexperienced brands with established good \\npractice standards. \\n\\nIn 2018 we will continue to grow the team \\nto cover more recently introduced branded \\nproducts such as face and body (cosmetics), \\njewellery and homeware. \\n\\nASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nREPORTING MECHANISMS\\n\\nASOS has a number of formal and informal \\nfeedback mechanisms across its operations and \\nworks hard to create a culture where employees \\ncan share concerns and ideas. \\n\\nFor those who wish to give anonymous  \\nfeedback, ASOS has an independently  \\noperated 24/7 helpline for employees called \\n“We’re Listening”, through which they can raise \\nany concerns, including human rights and  \\nworking conditions. In 2016-17 the helpline \\ncovered ASOS employees and contractors in \\nASOS premises, as well as UK factory workers. \\n\\nThis helpline has now been rolled out to workers \\nin our eight largest sourcing regions, including \\nChina, India, Mauritius, Romania, Bulgaria, \\nVietnam, Cambodia and Italy. \\n\\nReports are received by ASOS’ General  \\nCounsel and Company Secretary for  \\ninvestigation and passed to the appropriate \\nteam for remediation, remaining strictly  \\nconfidential at all times. The operation of the  \\nhelpline and remediation processes are \\noverseen by the Business Integrity Governance \\nGroup.\\n\\nIn Turkey, we will be piloting a separate hotline \\nin partnership with IndustriALL Global Union, \\nas part our Global Framework Agreement. \\nThe hotline will operate in Turkish and Arabic, \\nproviding  information to workers about their \\nrights and giving them access to remedy. A \\nmonitoring committee, composed of IndustriALL \\nlocal affiliates and ASOS, will be established \\nto monitor the implementation of our Global \\nFramework Agreement and workers’ access to \\nremedy through the hotline. \\n\\nNON-STOCK PROCUREMENT\\n\\nASOS recognises that it has a responsibility, \\nand an opportunity, to embed ethical  \\npurchasing practices within both stock and  \\nnon-stock procurement.  \\n\\nUntil 2015, the focus of our ethical trade \\nprogrammes was on ASOS Brands’ product \\nmanufacturing sites. However, since 2015 we \\nhave extended our ethical trade programme to \\nnon-stock providers of goods and services. \\n\\nWe have set-up a non-stock governance group \\nto guide the implementation of our Fashion \\nwith Integrity strategy across the non-stock \\narea of our business. The group is chaired by \\nour Supply Chain Director and includes senior \\nrepresentatives from Procurement, Technology, \\nFacilities, Supply Chain, Logistics, Corporate \\n\\nResponsibility, and Ethical Trade. Since starting \\nthis programme, we have conducted a risk \\nassessment of our top 250 suppliers, which \\nrepresent 95% of our total non-stock  \\nprocurement spend. Examples of these include \\nfreight handling, distribution, order fulfilment \\nand returns processing. \\n\\nWe have amended our ethical trade policies, \\nincluding the ASOS Supplier Ethical Code, \\nASOS Child and Young Worker Policy and \\nASOS Migrant and Contract Worker Policy to \\nextend their scope of application to our  \\nnon-stock supply chain.  We have also included \\nthese in our contracts with non-stock suppliers \\nand reserved the right to audit against those \\nstandards. \\n\\nFollowing our initial risk assessment, we  \\nprioritised the top 50 highest risk suppliers \\naccording to spend, industry, geography and \\nknown ethical risks and sent them a  \\nself-assessment questionnaire to help gather \\nfurther information on their employment  \\npractices and ethical standards. We are now \\nin the process of engaging with individual \\nsuppliers to discuss any gaps identified against \\nour standards.  \\n\\nWe have also developed a roadmap to ensure \\nthat our highest risk sites are monitored on a \\nyearly basis. We will hire additional resource to \\noversee the implementation of our Fashion with \\nIntegrity strategy across our non-stock supply \\nchain in 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\nTraining and Awareness Raising\\nWe continue to use the Modern Slavery Act as an opportunity to \\nembed greater understanding of human rights within our product \\nmanufacturing supply chains, and importantly, to extend this \\nawareness to other business areas and thus improve the approach \\ntowards third-party brands and non-stock purchasing. For ASOS, \\nthis means continuing to develop targeted training for those \\nemployees most directly involved in making purchasing decisions \\nwhich impact the risk of modern slavery across our business  \\noperations. It also means recognising the complex nature of  \\nmodern slavery and developing informative and accessible \\ntraining for all employees to increase their awareness of the risk of \\nmodern slavery in our business and the wider fashion industry. \\n\\nASOS CEO and Executive Directors are regularly briefed and \\nengaged in discussions on human rights and modern slavery, and \\nour Fashion with Integrity Governance structure ensures that key \\nissues are disseminated throughout the ASOS Leadership team. \\n\\nThis year we have offered several modern slavery training  \\nopportunities for employees and suppliers: \\n\\n• We partnered with Anti-Slavery International to develop \\ninternal training on modern slavery. We have piloted two \\nmodern slavery workshops within the business. The first group \\ntargeted our Buying, Merchandising, Design and Garment \\nTechnology teams, and the second targeted Non-Stock  \\nbusiness areas. We will roll out an informative and accessible \\nmodern slavery training programme to the entire business in \\nApril 2018.\\n\\n• We sponsored an ETI training course for our auditors in China \\nto enable them to spot indicators of modern slavery.\\n\\n• We partnered with Mauritian Export Association and  \\nAnti-Slavery International to deliver a two-day intensive  \\n\\ntraining on modern slavery to four Mauritian suppliers (10 \\nfactories) and other local manufacturers.\\n\\n• We piloted a training programme for women workers on \\ngender equality, discrimination, harassment and violence \\nagainst women in two Turkish factories. \\n\\n• We developed internal training for third-party brand buyers \\non the risk of modern slavery in supply chains.\\n\\n• We hosted a multi-stakeholder roundtable on modern slavery \\nin Mauritius in partnership with the British High Commission in \\nMauritius. \\n\\n• We continue to run supplier workshops for ASOS Brands \\nsuppliers in UK, Turkey, China, India, Mauritius and Eastern \\nEurope on a yearly basis.\\n\\n• We have developed a series of supply chain mapping and  \\nsubcontracting awareness workshops to be delivered to \\nin March 2018. Buying and Merchandising teams will be \\ntrained on the importance of supply chain mapping and the \\nrisks of lack of transparency. The training will also equip them \\nwith the tools to effectively address any questions from  \\nsuppliers about tackling modern slavery in their supply \\nchains.\\n\\n• We are developing a comprehensive training programme for \\nBuying and Merchandising designed to improve our  \\npurchasing practices. The training will cover cost prices,  \\nmodels and negotiation, production lead times and man-\\nufacturing processes, forecasting process, and ethical and \\nsustainable policies. We will also be developing a  \\nprogramme of factory visits for all Buyers and Merchandisers \\nto enable them to better understand production processes.\\n\\n10ASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nStakeholder Engagement and Partnerships\\n\\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\\n\\nWe understand that success in preventing modern slavery is \\nunlikely to be achieved by brands working independently. As \\nlong term members of the Ethical Trading Initiative and a number \\nof multi stakeholder programmes, we believe that the key to real \\nprogress is collaboration – across industries, and with NGO, \\ngovernment and trade union partners. \\n\\nWe have actively lobbied governments in recognition that the \\nrisks we face may be larger than ASOS and require government \\nengagement to achieve sustainable change. In Mauritius, we \\nhave engaged with stakeholders to end debt bondage, including \\nlobbying the Mauritian government to sign a bilateral agreement \\nwith Bangladesh that includes specific language relating to safe \\nlabour migration between two countries. \\n\\nIn Turkey, we are a signatory of the Fair Labour Association’s \\nletter to Turkish President sent in April 2017, calling for greater \\n\\naccess to work for Syrian refugees in Turkey. We also support the \\nFair Labour Association’s project with Turkish Ministry of Labour \\nto develop and share workers’ rights and permit applications \\nhandbooks. \\n\\nWe were also approached directly by the Australian  \\nGovernment to lodge a submission to support the development of \\nlegislation on modern slavery similar to the UK Modern Slavery \\nAct. The opportunity was welcomed by ASOS and we submitted \\na letter of support detailing certain legislative recommendations, \\nfor example a mandatory reporting requirement, legislation that \\ncovers both the public and private sector, enforcing penalties \\nfor failure to report, full supply chain coverage and a published \\nlist of those companies required to report. This has contributed \\nto a recent report setting out final recommendations for modern \\nslavery legislation to the Australian Government.\\n\\nhttps://www.asosplc.com/~/media/Files/A/Asos-V2/documents/corporate-responsiblity/letter-to-the-mauritian-labour-minister.pdf\\nhttp://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/committees/reportjnt/024102/toc_pdf/HiddeninPlainSight.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf\\n\\n\\nProgress Report on Commitments 2016-2017\\n\\nN\\not started\\n\\nBehind\\n\\nIn Progress\\n\\nCom\\npleted\\n\\nPublish our factory list on ASOS corporate website by 31st March 2017.\\n\\nEstablish a formal corporate responsibility governance structure reporting to ASOS plc Board.\\n\\nReview employee and non-stock supplier policies to ensure they provide adequate protection against \\nmodern slavery.\\n\\nLaunch an ethical trade support programme for third party brand suppliers.\\n\\nImprove stakeholder engagement by working directly with a human rights NGO in the role of ‘critical \\nfriend’.\\n\\nSignificant increase in number of ASOS ethical trade team and Regional Team members worldwide.\\n\\nExtend UK Living Wage (as defined by the Living Wage Foundation) to all UK outsourced workers, \\nincluding third party distribution, fulfilment and customer care centre workers and their agency  \\nemployees.\\n\\nExtend UK whistleblowing helpline to cover all ASOS Brands sourcing regions in relevant languages.\\n\\nProgress Report and Further Commitments\\n\\n11ASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nAnti-Slavery International: We established a partnership with \\nAnti-Slavery International, a world-leading NGO working to  \\neliminate all forms of slavery. Acting as a ‘critical friend’,  \\nAnti-Slavery International is assisting us in reviewing our practices \\nto ensure they are in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business \\nand Human Rights. We are also working together to provide a  \\nsustainable solution to the issues faced by migrant workers in our \\nsupply chain in Mauritius, assess key risks faced by workers  \\nemployed in our non-stock supply chain, and develop modern  \\nslavery training for ASOS staff and our suppliers. Anti-Slavery  \\nInternational also attended our UK supplier conferences and carried \\nout training sessions on modern slavery.\\n\\nGlobal Framework Agreement with IndustriALL: ASOS is \\nthe first e-commerce brand to sign a Global Framework Agreement \\nwith IndustriALL. It represents a strong framework for implementing \\nfreedom of association and other labour rights in our supply chain, \\n\\nPARTNERSHIPS\\n\\nregardless of existing standards of a particular country. IndustriALL \\nrepresents 50 million workers in 140 countries campaigning for \\ntrade union rights and better working conditions around the world. \\nTogether, we are developing methodologies to assess the impact \\nof purchasing practices on workers; implement confidential worker \\nhotlines to ensure workers have access to remedy; and roll out a \\ntraining programme for workers, factory managers, and suppliers.\\n\\nEthical Trading Initiative: ASOS has been a member of an \\nalliance of companies, NGO’s and trade unions called the Ethical \\nTrading Initiative since 2009.

The Mauritius working group, formed in 2015, is \\nsupporting the development of a roadmap of sustainable and lasting \\nchange.\\n\\nPartnerships are integral for ASOS in addressing modern slavery risks. \\nWe have been actively involved with the following organisations and initiatives:\\n\\nFurther Commitments to 2020\\n\\nN\\not started\\n\\nBehind\\n\\nIn Progress\\n\\nCom\\npleted\\n\\nCollaborate further with industry peers, NGO’s and trade unions to address systemic issues which are \\nat the root of labour abuses and therefore create opportunity for actions against modern slavery to \\nflourish.\\n\\nExtend supplier compliance and ethical standards training to all sourcing regions.\\n\\nReview how reward and progression strategy can be used internally to drive improvements in  \\npurchasing practices.\\n\\nImplement workers’ rights, freedom of association and right to collective bargaining training in Turkey \\nin collaboration with IndustriALL to all our tier 1 factories and at least 50% of our lower tier factories.\\n\\nSupport and guide third-party brands in meeting the minimum requirements through a comprehensive \\ntraining programmes that includes online training modules.\\n\\n\\n\\nSigned\\n\\nNick Beighton\\nCEO, ASOS plc\\n29 March 2018\\n\\n12ASOS Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 - March 2018\\n\\nAssessment of Effectiveness in \\nPreventing Modern Slavery\\n\\nModern slavery is a complex, multi-faceted issue, which is often hidden and therefore difficult to address effectively. Issues such as debt \\nbondage and child labour are driven by a variety of factors that are beyond the direct control of any individual business. Our  \\nresponsibility as a brand is to ensure that our due diligence systems are sufficiently robust to avoid complicity with such abuses and \\nremediate any instances we identify in our supply chain. We also need to work with other actors, including government, civil society and \\ntrade unions on systemic interventions with a long-term impact. \\n\\nSupply chain mapping, and sharing of information within our industry and beyond, increase the probability that issues will be identified \\nand addressed. Increasing supply chain transparency is therefore a fundamental aspect of our approach to eliminating modern slavery \\nin our operations, and something we continue to prioritise. We understand that as we continue to map further down our supply chains, \\nwe will expose further risks of modern slavery, and we recognise that we will need to continually renew our efforts to minimise negative \\nhuman rights impacts on vulnerable people in our supply chain.\\n\\nEqually, we recognise that we must continue to be pro-active, and try to address the root causes of these issues before they occur in our \\nfactories. We place an emphasis on providing decent employment opportunities for workers in our supply chain, and work to create an \\nenabling environment for them to be able to freely associate and bargain collectively for their rights. As part of our Global Framework \\nAgreement with IndustriALL, we will deliver training to workers in our supply chain about their rights, with the aim of empowering them to \\nbe agents of change in the workplace.\\n\\nIn addition, we work collaboratively with others to resolve issues that occur often before workers reach the factory gates, such as  \\nfraudulent recruitment practices leading to debt bondage. We focus on driving sustainable long-lasting change through government \\nlobbying and NGO partnerships, and developing our approach to third-party brands and non-stock procurement. \\n\\nAs a fast growing and changing organisation, we need to be particularly aware of emerging risks and be alert to the dynamic nature of \\nboth modern slavery and the impacts of our own operations.  We will therefore continue to reflect on, develop and extend our  \\napproach to modern slavery, both in the breadth of approach across non-stock and third-party brands’ supply chains and in the depth \\nof work within product sourcing regions.\\n\\nASOS’ Modern Slavery Statement September 2016 – March 2018 was prepared by the ASOS Modern Slavery working group and \\napproved on behalf of the ASOS Board of Directors on 29 March 2018.\\n\\n\\n'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":33}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AU_MS6MXVe_L","colab_type":"code","outputId":"77353e85-c875-41db-9193-4ab5f9e9d27b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570528002467,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":2434,"user":{"displayName":"Leung
